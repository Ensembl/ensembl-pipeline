=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a script to compare (cDNA-alignment) features in two databases.
It is used a a health-check / result-analysis after running the cDNA_update script,
which adds the latest cDNA information on an existing gene-build.
This script writes out a file for every chromosome containing the location of
features that were missed and that were added respectively in the new run.
It bases the comparison on genes and tries to trace the hits using the supporting evidence.
