=head1 NAME

  new_polyA_clipping.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Script to parse a fasta file and identify sequences with polyA/T
  tails/heads these are then clipped and stored in a file. Clipped,
  and potentially trimmed, sequences that are shorter than the
  specified minimum length are not stored.

=head2 Clipping

  - The non-A/T sequences at the ends must be <=10bp (set by $buffer)
  - The polyA/T string must be >4bp to be removed
  - It only clips polyA tails or polyT heads using a sliding window of 3 bp
  - The clipping is recursive but only clips one end of a sequence
  - The head/tail is only clipped if the polyA/T string is longer than
    the non-polyA/T string at the end of the sequence

=head1 OPTIONS

  -readfile     Input sequence file in fasta format
  -outfile      Output file in fasta format
  -min_length   Minimum sequence length (default 60)
  -trim         Flag for trimming
  -comments     sequence quality file

  Note that the -trim and -comments options are dependent and need
  to be specified together when trimming the sequences. The sequence
  quality file should contain the following tab columns:

    1./ accession number
    2./ high quality sequence start or stop
    3./ numeric value

  For human ESTs, the sequence quality file can be created by
  connecting to the Mole embl database and doing the following query,
  changing tax_division and data_class as appropriate:

    SELECT accession_version,comment_key,comment_value
    FROM entry e, comment c
    WHERE e.entry_id = c.entry_id
    AND e.tax_division = 'HUM'
    AND e.data_class = 'EST'

  The query takes about 5 mins for 1 million ESTs, depending on how
  busy the database is.

=head1 EXAMPLES

  For only polA clipping:

    perl new_polyA_clipping.pl -readfile sequences.fasta -outfile polyat_clipped.out

  For trimming and polyA clipping:

    perl new_polyA_clipping.pl -readfile sequences.fasta -outfile polyat_clipped.out -trim -comments comments.ls

  For trimming and polyA clipping with specified min length cutoff:

    perl new_polyA_clipping.pl -readfile sequences.fasta -outfile polyat_clipped.out -trim -comments comments.ls -min_length 50
