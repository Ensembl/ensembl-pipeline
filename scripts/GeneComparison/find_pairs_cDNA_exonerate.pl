=head1 NAME

  find_pairs_cDNA_exonerate.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
  /path/to/exonerate/output/> find_pairs_cDNA_exonerate.pl -file ../best_pairs
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  script to process the exonerate output from the comparison of two sets of cDNA sequences. 
  It assumes the output is in one or more gzip'ed files.
  It should be run in the directory where those files exist.

  It takes all matches and does an 'stable marriage' algorithm to find the best pairs. 
  It prints the results in a file given with the option -file
  
=head1 OPTIONS

  -file ../filename
  where teh output goes. It is convenient to send it to another directory not to confuse the script.
