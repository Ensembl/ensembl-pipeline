=head1 NAME

RuleHandler.pl - handles insertion, deletion and listing of rules in a database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

RuleHandler.pl -optio

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  This script allows the user to list all analysisprocesses and rules
  in a database, insert rules and delete rules. Checks for circular
  dependencies and fulfilment of conditions are made before rules are
  inserted. Rules cannot be deleted if other rules depend upon them.

=head1 OPTIONS

    -dbhost     host name for database (gets put as host= in locator)

    -dbport     For RDBs, what port to connect to (port= in locator)

    -dbname     For RDBs, what name to connect to (dbname= in locator)

    -dbuser     For RDBs, what username to connect as (dbuser= in locator)

    -dbpass     For RDBs, what password to use (dbpass= in locator)

    -help       Displays script documentation with PERLDOC

    -analyses   Lists all available analysisprocesses

    -rules      Lists all available rules together with conditions and goals

    -delete     Deletes a rule based on value of id. Requires
                additional qualifier, -ruleId.

    -ruleId     ID of rule to be deleted (required by -delete)

    -insert     Inserts a rule that has the given goal and conditions
                (requires additional qualifiers -goal and -condition

     -goal      Goal analysis for the rule to be inserted (goal and
                conditions must be logic_names)

     -condition Conditions required for rule to be inserted. A rule
                can have more than one condition; each must be prefaced by
                -condition, eg -condition condition1 -condition condition2
