=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::General

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::General;
    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::General qw();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

General pipeline configuration.

It imports and sets a number of standard global variables into the
calling package. Without arguments all the standard variables are set,
and with a list, only those variables whose names are provided are set.
The module will die if a variable which doesn\'t appear in its
C<%Config> hash is asked to be set.

The variables can also be references to arrays or hashes.

Edit C<%Config> to add or alter variables.

All the variables are in capitals, so that they resemble environment
variables.
